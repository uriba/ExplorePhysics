    "### Lesson 1, Introduction\n",
    "In this lesson, we will learn how to install and start the jupyter notebook.\n",
    "After the installation, we will introduce some useful examples of how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to install the required elements for jupyter notebook.\n",
    "We recommend installing the anaconda package from [this link](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).\n",
    "* Choose python version 3.5 and the appropriate operating system.\n",
    "* It is recomended to install 'for this user only' and not 'for all users'.\n",
    "* There is no need to register to anaconda.org at this point.\n",
    "* If you are using Windows, to start jupyter notebook, go to the start menu, type 'jupyter notebook' in the search box and press enter.\n",
    "    For other operating systems see [this link](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html).\n",
    "* Once started, a new tab in your internet browser will open up and you will see a list of the files and folders in the the start-up folder of jupyter notebook.\n",
    "    At this point you can only work on files within this folder or its subfolders. \n",
    "* Using this screen, we recommend to create a new folder for the tutorial files.\n",
    "    Note that when choosing \"New\" -> \"Folder\" from the top right part of the menu, a new folder named \"Untitled Folder\" is created.\n",
    "    To change the name of the folder you need to click the checkbox left of it, and then the \"Rename\" button on the top left.\n",
    "* Next you need to open this document using Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "    If you haven't done so already, and are still reading this document at the anaconda.org website, right-click 'Download' in the upper right side of the screen, choose \"Save link as...\" and save the file in the dedicated folder you created.\n",
    "    If you don't know where the new folder is located in your computer, follow the instructions in [this video](https://youtu.be/-QAED9UaMIE).\n",
    "* Now open the file you downloaded from the jupyter notebook tab in your browser.\n",
    "    This will open a new tab in the browser with this lesson.\n",
    "    Make sure to close the tab where you read the same file from anaconda.org so you don't get confused.\n",
    "    This lesson cannot be completed when reading directly from the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, when working on these tutorials, first download them to your computer in this way, and open them using jupyter notebook."
