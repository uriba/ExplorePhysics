    "* len(A) returns the length of the array A.\n",
    "* Elements in an array are accessed with square brackets. The first element of an array A is A[0], the second A[1] and so on. A[-1] is the last element, A[-2] is the second last etc. A[3:6] is an array with elements A[3],A[4], A[5]. A[2:] is an array with elements from A[2] to the end. A[:5] are all the elements up to but not including A[5].\n",
    "* Graphs can be made using the 'plot' command. If a and b are arrays of equal length, then plot(a,b) will plot b vs a.\n",
    "* The markers and line styles of curves can be set by adding a string: plot(a,b,'r.') will have red dots, while plot(a,b,'b') will plot the curve with a solid blue line.\n",
    "* The basic colors are b-blue, r-red, g-green, y-yellow, c-cyan, m-magenta, k-black, w-white\n",
    "* A few useful marker types are: '.', 'o', 'x', '\\*'.\n",
    "* The title can be set by the command suptitle('distance as function of time'), the x and y labels by xlabel('time in seconds') and ylabel('distance in meters').\n",
